# lanzarett

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jakoblorz/lanzarett.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jakoblorz/lanzarett)

**lanzarett** is targeting teams that need to code an api as fast as possible - using endpoint-contracts, the requirements of each endpoint can 
be determined easily to start a server and invoke the endpoint-functions upon request or to generate the client-sdks.
Adding new functionality is super straight-forward: add the contract-file and regenerate the sdks - no slowing down the teams performance!
